For anyone who would like to try the code locally, please read this instruction.

### **Local environment required:**
Python 3.0+, 
Any compiler that support Python, such as Webstorm or Pycharm(no Jupyternotebook!),  
Python modules: pymysql, flask

### **To run this project:**

After opening the folder, run these two commands at the compiler terminal one by one: "export FLASK_APP=app.py"(in this command, use "export" on mac and "set" instead on windows) and "flask run".   

If the warning says there's any module needed, just install the module(on mac, it is a  "pip install the_module_name"  command at terminal). If all the previous steps wordked, the compiler terminal would look like this:
